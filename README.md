# pibackdrop

This is a hacky thing to make a raspberry pi display a set of differet background images on its displays based on a control signal I haven't figured out yet.

The use case is for having the pi connected to a projector that'll display different background images during a live music gig. Album covers, song artwork, etc.

Ideas for the control bits is remotely via phone/ipad using a web app, or using MIDI over usb directly. Haven't figured it out yet.


## Install directions

### Basics

Install raspbian on a rpi. Use `raspi-config` under "Display" to make sure you're not running wayland.
